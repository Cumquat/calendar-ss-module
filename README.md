# Silverstripe Events and Calendar Module
## Overview
This module is forked from mrvdot's moduale and provides a Calendar pagetype for Silverstripe that allows for multiple events to be created/managed, as well as events pulled in from Google Calendar.

## Notice
Please note this module is only compatible with SS v3.0+

## Thanks
This module uses Adam Shaw's awesome [Full Calendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/) module, which takes care of most of the frontend display of the 'Calendar' view for all events.
